- 👋 Hi! My name is Brendan.
- 👀 I’m a Technical Writer who lives and works in the Netherlands.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on software documentation in a FinTech organisation, have experience reviewing API specifications, and I'm interested in process automation, static site generation, and the impact of AI on content creation and technical writing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I can offer help and that I find personally interesting.
- 📫 How to reach me: You will find a way!
